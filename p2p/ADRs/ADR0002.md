# ADR-002: Simplifying Identity by Adopting LibP2P Address as a Base

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Development Team, Architecture Team, Product Owner
* Date: 2023-04-14

Technical Story: [#434 - Review Hotstuff Node IDs](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues/434)

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to simplify and consolidate our identity system to improve maintainability and scalability. The decision we must make is whether to adopt the LibP2P address as a base for our identity system.

## Decision Drivers

* Maintainability
* Scalability
* Interoperability

## Considered Options

* Keep existing identity system and mapping
* Replace NodeId in consensus with node-wide identity
* Adopt LibP2P address as a base

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Adopt LibP2P address as a base", because it simplifies the identity system and provides better interoperability.

### Positive Consequences

* Simplified identity management
* Improved interoperability with the LibP2P ecosystem

### Negative Consequences

* Potential codebase changes

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Keep existing identity system and mapping

* Good, because it doesn't require significant changes to the codebase
* Bad, because it maintains complexity in identity management
* Bad, because it may not be as interoperable

### Replace NodeId in consensus with node-wide identity

* Bad, because it requires clarification of the purpose of consensus NodeId first, as per [#434 - Review Hotstuff Node IDs](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues/434)

### Adopt LibP2P address as a base

* Good, because it simplifies the identity system
* Good, because it improves interoperability with the LibP2P ecosystem
