# ADR-001: Adopting Multiaddr for Addressing and Protocol Handling

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Development Team, Architecture Team, Product Owner
* Date: 2023-04-14

Technical Story: [#434 - Review Hotstuff Node IDs](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues/434)

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a flexible and extensible addressing system that can support various protocols and be interoperable with the LibP2P ecosystem. The decision we must make is whether to adopt multi-addresses as our addressing system.

## Decision Drivers

* Interoperability
* Extensibility
* Standardization

## Considered Options

* Maintain current addressing system
* Support multi-addresses

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Support multi-addresses", because it provides better interoperability, extensibility, and standardization.

### Positive Consequences

* Better interoperability with LibP2P ecosystem
* Extensible addressing system
* Standardized serialization format

### Negative Consequences

* Additional dependency on multi-address library
* Learning curve for multi-address abstraction

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Maintain current addressing system

* Good, because it doesn't require significant changes to the codebase
* Bad, because it may not be as extensible and interoperable

### Support multi-addresses

* Good, because it provides a standardized serialization format
* Good, because it supports arbitrarily nested protocols and values, making it extensible
* Bad, because it introduces an additional dependency
* Bad, because it requires learning a new abstraction
